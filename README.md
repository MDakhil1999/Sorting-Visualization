# Sorting-Visualization
## Visualized Sorting Algorithms

I was fascinated by sorting algorithms and planned to visualize the action of these algorithms.

I visualized the following sorting algorithms using HTML,CSS and JS.

1)Bubble sort

2)Selection Sort

3)Insertion Sort

4)Quick Sort

5)Merge Sort

6)Heap Sort

I was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu. This project really helps me on brushing sorting algorithms and helped me to learn timer function in JavaScript.

## Features of this project
* Size of the array.
* Speed of the algorithm.
* Generate new array.
* 6 sorting implementations.

## Characteristics
* We can see step by step what is happening.

4 colours are used here for easy understanding.
* Yellow
* Blue
* Red
* Green

* The number of elements in array ie size of array varies from 20(minimum) to 150(maximum).
* The speed of algorithm is in 5 steps varies from 1(minimum) to 5(maximum).
* 6 sorting algorithms are visualised here.
